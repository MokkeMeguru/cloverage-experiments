# cloverage-experiment

lein cloverage @1.2.2 bug's report

## detail

isolated code is not watched by cloverage.

e.g. the namespace #'cloverage-experiment.error is the below code.

```clojure
(ns cloverage-experiment.utils.error)

(defn bind-error [f [val err]]
  (if (nil? err)
    (f val)
    [nil err]))

(defmacro err->> [val & fns]
  (let [fns (for [f fns] `(bind-error ~f))]
    `(->> [~val nil]
          ~@fns)))
```

this namespace is isolated because it has no requiements.

and then, the namespace #'cloverage-experiment.core is the below code.

```clojure
(ns cloverage-experiment.core
  (:require [clojure.core]) ;; need here code!!!
  )

(defn foo
  "I don't do a whole lot."
  [x]
  (println x "Hello, World!"))

(defn main []
  (print "hello"))
```

this namespace is not isolated because it requires #'clojure.core

so that, cloverage result is here.
